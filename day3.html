		<h2 id="Top">Morning</h2>
		<p> <br>Explore the fashionable Place du Grand Sablon and the area's must see, the Notre Dame du Sablon.</p>
		
		<h3> Place du Grand Sablon</h3>
		<p> <br>Situated between the divisions of the Upper and Lower town in Brussels, it is like a stepping stone between the Upper and Lower towns. The mean
		ing "sablon" in French means sand and the square is so-called because this old route was passed through an area of sandy marshes. However, the modern
	    picture is very different as the area is surrounded by elegant townhouses, some with the Art Nouveau facades. This is a very chic, wealthy and antique
		place  where fashionable restaurants, bars and chocolate shops lie.</p>
			
		<h3> Notre Dame du Sablon </h3>
		<p> <br>Notre Dame du Sablon is very similar to the Cathedral Sts Michel et Gudule, it is one of the Brabant Gothic architecture in Belgium. The church
		was first built on a legend stating that a girl has seen Virgin Mary who instructed her to take her statue to Brussels. Therefore, at the entrance we 
		can see two carvings stating the myth after the statue was destroyed in 1565. The interior of the building is simple but beautifully proportioned. 
		It contains 14 m high glasses, and lights shine out at night like welcoming beacons.</p>
